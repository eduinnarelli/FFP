abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we describe a computational study conducted on The Firefighter Problem (FFP), which models fire spreading and containment in a graph. Once the fire breaks out on a set of vertices, the goal is to save as many vertices as possible with limited resources. Practical applications of the FFP occur in areas such as disease control and network security. The FFP is NP-hard and heuristics have been proposed earlier. Our main contributions include improvements to an existing integer linear programming formulation that led to an average speedup of two to compute exact solutions. Moreover, we developed a novel matheuristic, a technique based on the interoperation between metaheuristics and mathematical programming. We performed extensive experiments on public benchmarks both for parameter tuning and for comparison of our results with those from the literature. A rigorous statistical analysis shows that our new matheuristic outperforms the existing approaches.},

While only two firefighters per time step are needed in the two-dimensional lattice to contain any outbreak, we prove a conjecture of Wang and Moeller [Fire control on graphs, J. Combin. Math. Combin. Comput. 41 (2002) 19–34] that 2d-1 firefighters per time step are needed to contain a fire outbreak starting at a single vertex in the d-dimensional square lattice for d⩾3; we also prove that in the d-dimensional lattice, d⩾3, for each positive integer f there is some outbreak of fire such that f firefighters per time step are insufficient to contain the outbreak. We prove another conjecture of Wang and Moeller that the proportion of elements in the three-dimensional grid Pn×Pn×Pn which can be saved with one firefighter per time step when an outbreak starts at one vertex goes to 0 as n gets large. Finally, we use integer programming to prove results about the minimum number of time steps needed and minimum number of burnt vertices when containing a fire outbreak in the two-dimensional square lattice with two firefighters per time step."

The same model has also been used in the literature for the simulation of the spreading of deseases. In this work we present, to our knowledge, the first metaheuristics for tackling this problem. In particular, a pure ant colony optimization approach and a hybrid variant of this algorithm are proposed. The results show that the hybrid ant colony optimization variant is superior to the pure ant colony optimization version and to a mathematical programming solver, especially when the graph size and density grows.",

Once the fire breaks out at a set of vertices, the goal addressed in this work is to save as many vertices as possible from burning. Although the problem finds applications in various real-world problems, such as the spread of diseases or hoaxes contention in communication networks, this problem has not been addressed from a practical point of view so far, in the sense of finding a good strategy for the general case. In this work, we develop and compare several integer linear programming techniques and heuristic methods. Random graphs are used for the purpose of comparison. The obtained results shed some light on the challenges for computational tools as caused by graph topology, graph size, and the number of firefighters per iteration, when looking for the best strategy for an a priori unknown graph."

abstract="The firefighter problem (FFP) is used as a model to simulate how a fire breaks out and spreads to its surroundings over a discrete time period. The goal is to deploy a given number of firefighters on strategic points at each time step to contain the fire in a most efficient way, so that as many areas are saved from the fire as possible. In this paper we introduce a new solution representation for the FFP which can be applied in metaheuristic approaches. Compared to the existing approach in the literature, it is more compact in a sense that the solution space is smaller although the complexity for evaluating a solution remains unchanged. We use this representation in conjunction with a variable neighborhood search (VNS) approach to tackle the FFP. To speed up the optimization process, we propose an incremental evaluation technique that omits unnecessary re-calculations. Computational tests were performed on a benchmark instance set containing 120 random graphs of different size and density. Results indicate that our VNS approach is highly competitive with existing state-of-the-art approaches.",

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},
